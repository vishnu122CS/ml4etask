# ml4etask
made a machine learning model for wine quality classification<br>
objective: to make a ML model<br>
. Used scikilearn to contruct the model<br>
. Done some basic exploratory data analysis<br>
. Plotted some graphs using seaborn and matplotib<br>
. Used Correlation analysis to know about parameters<br>
. Dimensionality reduction on basis of correlation coeffecient<br>
. splitted the data into train and test data<br>
. Used different ML models to train Data<br>
. Based on accuracy score , done hyperparameter tuning<br>
. Finally bought the best params , for best predictions<br>
. Evaluated the model using Confusion matrix for y_test , y_preds.<br>
