# ml4etask
made a machine learning model for wine quality classification
objective: to make a ML model 
. Used scikilearn to contruct the model
. Done some basic exploratory data analysis
. Plotted some graphs using seaborn and matplotib
. Used Correlation analysis to know about parameters
. Dimensionality reduction on basis of correlation coeffecient
. splitted the data into train and test data
. Used different ML models to train Data
. Based on accuracy score , done hyperparameter tuning
. Finally bought the best params , for best predictions
. Evaluated the model using Confusion matrix for y_test , y_preds.
